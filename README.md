# ibm-ds-capstone
->In this capstone, we predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

->Collect data on the Falcon 9 first-stage landings. Use a RESTful API and web scraping and3 convert the data into a dataframe and then perform some data wrangling.

->Build a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash and then build an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium.

->Use machine learning to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully. Split your data into training data and test data to find the best Hyperparameter for SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression. Then find the method that performs best using test data.
